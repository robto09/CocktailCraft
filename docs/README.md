# CocktailCraft Documentation

This directory contains documentation for the CocktailCraft application, a Kotlin Multiplatform app for Android that allows users to browse, favorite, and order cocktails.

## Architecture Diagrams

I've created architecture diagrams to help understand the structure and design of our CocktailCraft application.

### Available Diagrams

1. **[High-Level Architecture](images/mermaid/high_level_architecture.md)**: Overview of our application's layered architecture
2. **[Component Diagram](images/mermaid/component_diagram.md)**: Main components and their interactions
3. **[Use Case Diagram](images/mermaid/use_case_diagram.md)**: User interactions with our system
4. **[Class Diagram](images/mermaid/class_diagram.md)**: Key domain models and their relationships
5. **[Sequence Diagram - Place Order](images/mermaid/sequence_diagram_place_order.md)**: Interaction flow for placing an order
6. **[Data Flow Diagram](images/mermaid/data_flow_diagram.md)**: How data flows through our application
7. **[Package Diagram](images/mermaid/package_diagram.md)**: Organization of our codebase

These diagrams provide a comprehensive view of our application architecture, making it easier to understand the system design, onboard new team members, and plan future enhancements.

## Application Architecture

CocktailCraft follows Clean Architecture principles with a MVVM pattern for the UI layer:

## Additional Documentation

- **[Animations and Transitions](animations.md)**: Documentation of the app's animation system and implementation details, including:
  - Animation utilities and reusable components
  - Shimmer loading effects and micro-interactions
  - Batched loading mechanism for optimized list animations
  - Scrolling performance optimizations

- **[Recommendation System](RecommendationSystem.md)**: Documentation of the cocktail recommendation system, including:
  - API limitations and constraints
  - Recommendation strategies and algorithms
  - Implementation approach and optimization techniques
  - Future enhancement possibilities

### Key Architectural Layers

1. **UI Layer**:
   - Jetpack Compose UI components
   - Screen composables
   - Navigation

2. **ViewModel Layer**:
   - Manages UI state
   - Handles user actions
   - Communicates with domain layer

3. **Domain Layer**:
   - Business logic
   - Use cases
   - Repository interfaces
   - Domain models

4. **Data Layer**:
   - Repository implementations
   - Remote data sources (API)
   - Local data sources (Storage)
   - DTOs and mappers

5. **Platform-Specific**:
   - Android-specific implementations
   - iOS-specific implementations (in progress)

### Key Design Patterns

1. **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)**: Separates UI from business logic
2. **Repository Pattern**: Abstracts data sources
3. **Use Case Pattern**: Encapsulates business logic
4. **Dependency Injection**: Uses Koin for DI
5. **Observer Pattern**: Uses Kotlin Flow for reactive programming
6. **Clean Architecture**: Separation of concerns with clear boundaries

### Technologies

1. **Kotlin Multiplatform**: For sharing code between platforms
2. **Jetpack Compose**: For declarative UI on Android
3. **Kotlin Coroutines & Flow**: For asynchronous programming
4. **Koin**: For dependency injection
5. **Ktor**: For networking
6. **Kotlin Serialization**: For JSON parsing
7. **Settings**: For local storage

## Features

CocktailCraft provides the following features:

1. **Browse Cocktails**: View a list of cocktails with filtering and sorting options
2. **Cocktail Details**: View detailed information about a cocktail, including ingredients and instructions
3. **Cart Management**: Add cocktails to cart, update quantities, and remove items
4. **Order Management**: Place orders and view order history
5. **Favorites**: Save favorite cocktails for quick access
6. **User Profile**: View and edit user profile information
7. **Reviews**: Read and write reviews for cocktails

## Future Enhancements

1. **iOS Support**: Complete iOS implementation using Kotlin Multiplatform
2. **Backend Integration**: Develop a custom backend for user accounts, orders, and payments
3. **Offline Support**: Enhance offline capabilities with local caching
4. **Advanced Search**: Implement advanced search functionality
5. **Social Features**: Add social sharing and friend recommendations
6. **Personalization**: Implement personalized recommendations based on user preferences
